Solutions to the exercises in the book
_The Go Programming Language_
using TDD.

== Rules of TDD
. Write no more of a unit test than sufficient to fail
(compilation failures are failures).
. Write no more production code than necessary
to pass the one failing unit test.

== TDD in Go

TDD in Go is pretty straightforward.
It's a pity though that even the official book
_The Go Programming Language_
does not cover testing until chapter 11.
It contains sound advise
on how to write tests
and shows off Go's simple yet powerful approach.

In this repository
you will find solutions to the exercises in the book,
developed using TDD.
Each exercise has its own `README.adoc`
describing the TDD approach taken.
