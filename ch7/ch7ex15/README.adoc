Write a program that reads a single expression from the standard input,
prompts the user to provide values for any variables, then evaluates the expression in the
resulting environment. Handle all errors gracefully.

== Test
Can an example function interact with standard input?

The test focuses on ensuring we can correctly detect the variables to be supplied

This means testing `Expr.Check` reports what variables need a value to be supplied by the user.
