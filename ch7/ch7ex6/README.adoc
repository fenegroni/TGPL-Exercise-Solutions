Add support for Kelvin temperatures to `tempflag`.

== Test

In the book `tempflag` is the name of the package in 7.4.

In our test, we called the package `tempconv`
which was the name originally used in the book in Chapter 2.

Inside package `tempconv` we created a file called `tempflag.go`.

That's where we add support for Kelvin temperatures.
