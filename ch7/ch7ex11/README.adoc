{badge-exercise}

Add additional handlers so that
clients can create, read, update, and delete database entries.
For example, a request of the form `/update?item=socks&price=6`
will update the price of an item in the inventory
and report an error if the item does not exist or if the price is invalid.
(Warning: this change introduces concurrent variable updates.)

== Test

We set up a test server after calling `Exercise7_11`.
The tests assume the implementation uses `DefaultServeMux`.

We validate non-concurrent updates only for now.
