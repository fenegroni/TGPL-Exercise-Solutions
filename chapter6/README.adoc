== Methods

* {badge-exercise6-1}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6.1] +
Implement these additional methods...
* {badge-exercise6-2}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6.2] +
Define a variadic `AddAll(...int)` method that allows a list of values to be added.
* {badge-exercise6-3}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6.3] +
Implement methods for `IntersectWith`, `DifferenceWith`, and `SymmetricDifference`.
* {badge-exercise6-4}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6.4] +
Add a method `Elems` that returns a slice containing the elements of the set,
suitable for iterating over with a `range` loop.
* {badge-exercise6-5}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter6/exercise6.5] +
The type of each word used by `IntSet` is `uint64`, but 64-bit arithmetic may be
inefficient on a 32-bit platform. Modify the program to use the `uint` type.
