{badge-exercise}

Define a variadic `(*IntSet).AddAll(...int)` method that allows a list of
values to be added, such as `s.AddAll(1, 2, 3)`.

== Tests

For this test, we leverage the `TestIntSet` function we made for exercise 6.1.
For that reason we keep the code for `Add`, `Remove`, `Clear` and `String`
as used by the test.

For this exercise we also define the equivalent `RemoveAll` method
that takes a list of values to remove from the set.

We can then call `AddAll` and `RemoveAll`
instead of calling `Add` and `Remove` in a loop
to add and remove more than one value.
