{badge-exercise}

Add additional handlers so that
clients can create, read, update, and delete database entries.
For example, a request of the form `/update?item=socks&price=6`
will update the price of an item in the inventory
and report an error if the item does not exist or if the price is invalid.
(Warning: this change introduces concurrent variable updates.)

== Test

To validate the handlers we will not use a real http server,
but instead we will test the handlers directly.

This will allow us to further test concurrent access to the database variable.
