The `sort.Interface` type can be adapted to other uses.
Write a function
`IsPalindrome(s sort.Interface) bool`
that
reports whether the sequence `s` is a palindrome,
in other words,
reversing the sequence would not change it.
Assume that the elements at indices `i` and `j` are equal
if `!s.Less(i, j) && !s.Less(j, i)`.
