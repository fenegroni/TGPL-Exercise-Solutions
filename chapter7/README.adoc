== Interfaces

* {badge-exercise7-1}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.1] +
Using the ideas from `ByteCounter`, implement counters for words and for lines.
* {badge-exercise7-2}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.2] +
Write a function `CountingWriter` that returns a new `Writer` that wraps the original
and a pointer to an `int64` variable that contains the number of bytes written to the new `Writer`.
* {badge-exercise7-3}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.3] +
Write a `String` method for the `*tree` type in Section 4.4
that reveals the sequence of values in the tree.
* {badge-exercise7-4}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.4] +
Implement a simple version of `strings.NewReader`,
and use it to make the HTML parser take input from a string.
* {badge-exercise7-5}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.5] +
Implement the `LimitReader` function in the `io` package.
* {badge-exercise7-6}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.6] +
Add support for Kelvin temperatures to `tempflag`.
* {badge-exercise7-7}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.7] +
Explain why the help message contains `Â°C` when the default value of `20.0` does not.
* {badge-exercise7-8}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.8] +
Define an implementation of `sort.Interface` for use by a GUI table widget.
Compare that approach with repeated sorting using `sort.Stable`.
* {badge-exercise7-9}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.9] +
Use the `html/template` package (Section 4.6) to replace `printTracks` with a function
that displays the tracks as an HTML table.
* {badge-exercise7-10}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.10] +
Write a function
`IsPalindrome(s sort.Interface) bool`
that
reports whether the sequence `s` is a palindrome.
* {badge-exercise7-11}[link={url-base}/tree/master/chapter7/exercise7.11] +
Add additional handlers so that
clients can create, read, update, and delete database entries.
