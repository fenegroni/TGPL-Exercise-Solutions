{badge-exercise}

Modify the `corner` function in section 3.2 of the book,
to use named results and a bare return statement.

== Test

We rename the previous implementation of `corner` into `oldcorner`.
This allows us to compare the new implementation of `corner` to the old one.

=== `Test_corner`

An opaque-box test of `corner` vs. `oldcorner`.
Given the same input, we expect the same output from both functions.
If `oldcorner` returns NaN, we skip to the next iteration so that
a new Corner implementation can resolve the issue.

=== `TestCornerReturnsNaNOrInf`

Reports for what combinations of i and j
`corner` returns an invalid number (NaN or +/-Inf).
This was an issue with the original implementation
which we fix in Exercise 3.1.
