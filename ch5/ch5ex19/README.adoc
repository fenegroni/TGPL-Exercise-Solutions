Use `panic` and `recover` to write a function that contains no `return` statement
yet returns a non-zero value.

== Test

Because a function with a return value will not compile if it does not contain a return statement,
the test will validate that `panic` was called by comparing the result of `recover` to a known value.

=== No return

The function under test `NoReturnStatement` receives an argument and
calls `panic` with that argument.

`TestNoReturnStatement` calls `NoReturnStatement` with a known value and
checks that `recover` returns that argument.
