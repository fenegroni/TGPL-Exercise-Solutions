{badge-exercise}

Write a function to print the contents of all text nodes in an HTML document tree.
Do not descend into <script> or <style> elements,
since their content are not visible in a web browser.

== Test

The new function to be tested is called `PrintAllTextNodesContent`.

The test follows the same pattern as exercises 5.1 and 5.2,
except this time the `want` element of the test is a simple string.

[source,go]
----
struct {
	document string
	want     string
}
----

== Example

To make the output more predictable
I made sure all leading and trailing white space is removed and
empty lines are not printed.

Given this example HTML document as input:

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
        <style>
            p {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
        <h1>title</h1>
        <script src="javascript.js">
            document.write("hello!")
        </script>
        <p>line1</p>
        <p>line2</p>
    </body>
</html>
----

the Example function's `Output` is very simple.

[source,go]
----
// Output:
// title
// line1
// line2
----
