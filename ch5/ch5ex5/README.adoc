Implement `countWordsAndImages`.
(See Exercise 4.9 for word splitting.)

== Test

This is an example of a function that multiple return values.
Such functions are called _multi values functions_.

For the test's `got` variable I defined a struct `result`.

There's an exported function `CountWordsAndImages`,
which calls upon `countWordsAndImages`:
a recursive function
similar to `Visit` in Exercise 5.1.

We do not test the exported function
nor provide an example of how to call the inner function.
We will test the exported function in the future using `gomock`.

== Example

We don't provide examples for internal functions.
