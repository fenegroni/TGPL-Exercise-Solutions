{badge-exercise}

Write variadic functions `max` and `min`, analogous to `sum`.
What should these functions do when called with no arguments?
Write variants that require at least one argument.

== Test `Min` and `Max`

`TestMin` and `TestMax` follow a similar pattern.
The first argument of `Min` and `Max` is mandatory,
therefore it is not possible to call either functions with no arguments.

Nevertheless we do test calling with an empty or `nil` variadic argument list
to validate the function is not assuming it has been called with more than one argument.

== `Min2` and `Max2`

We can think of `Min2` and `Max2` as possible implementations
of optimised functions to when given only two numbers.

== Benchmarking `Min` vs `Min2`

We could improve this exercise further by benchmarking
the fictional `Min2` function against the regular `Min`
to determine performance improvements
when passing only two arguments.
