Change the `findlinks` program to traverse the `n.FirstChild` linked list
using recursive calls to `Visit` instead of a loop.

== Test

The implementation validates that given an HTML document with
zero, one, or more links,
they are all still returned by the new recursive implementation,
as they were returned by the original implementation.

=== Original implementation

The book's implementation of `Visit` uses a for-loop to visit `c.NextSibling` within the sub-node:

[source,go]
----
for c := n.FirstChild; c != nil; c = c.NextSibling {
	links = Visit(links, c)
}
----

=== Fully-recursive implementation

The solution to the exercise uses no such for loop.

`Visit` now recursively calls itself with the correct parameters:

[source,go]
----
return Visit(Visit(links, n.FirstChild), n.NextSibling)
----

== Example

Given this example HTML document as input:

[source,html]
----
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <a href="link1">a</a>
        <a href="link2">b</a>
    </body>
</html>
----

the Example function's `Output` is:

[source,go]
----
// Output:
// link1
// link2
----
