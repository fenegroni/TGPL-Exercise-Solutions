`(*IntSet).UnionWith` computes the union of two sets using `|`, the word-parallel bitwise OR operator.
Implement methods for `IntersectWith`, `DifferenceWith`, and `SymmetricDifference`
for the corresponding set operations. (The symmetric difference of two sets contains the elements
present in one set or the other but not both.)
