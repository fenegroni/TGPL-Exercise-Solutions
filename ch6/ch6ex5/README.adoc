{badge-exercise}

The type of each word used by `IntSet` is `uint64`, but 64-bit arithmetic may be
inefficient on a 32-bit platform. Modify the program to use the `uint` type, which is the most
efficient unsigned integer type for the platform. Instead of dividing by 64, define a constant
holding the effective size of `uint` in bits, 32 or 64. You can use the perhaps too-clever
expression `32 << (^uint(0) >> 63)` for this purpose.

== Test

We test the implementation by leveraging the work done for Exercise 6.1.

If the tests continue working, then we don't need to worry.

Going forward we might put IntSet in a separate package that the unit tests use.
