{badge-exercise}

Modify `crawl` to make local copies of the pages it finds,
creating directories as necessary.
Don't make copies of pages that come from a different domain.
For example, if the original page comes from `golang.org`,
save all files from there,
but exclude ones from `vimeo.com`.

== Test

This is a candidate for mocking.

One test to check files are saved as returned by the mock server.

Another test to make sure the server is not called for
resources from domains other than `golang.org`.

We can use package `net/httptest` to set up
an in place server and provide the
package `links` under test with an HTTP client
specific to the mock server.
