Without changing its behaviour, rewrite the `fetch` function to use `defer` to close the writable file.

== Test

We want to test that the file is correctly closed by defer.
We don't need to set up a server, and the file can be assumed to be local.
What we want is to make sure the file is closed correctly.

=== Implementation

We validate that defer works using an anonymous function to print a log line.
The output is validated using the 'deferred close call' sentence.

NOTE: A better strategy is to implement the OS file handle count.
Unfortunately this requires system calls to find out
if a file descriptor is in use by a process.
