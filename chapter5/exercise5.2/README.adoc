Write a function to populate a mapping from element names
- `p`, `div`, `span` and so on -
to the number of elements with that name in an HTML document tree

== Test

I wrote a function called `CountElements`,
very similar to `visit` in exercise 5.1.

The test is also very similar to the one in exercise 5.1,
except it uses a map between elements and their count.

[source,go]
----
struct {
	document string
	want     map[string]int
}
----

== Example

An `// Unordered output:` comment is necessary:
when printing the map contents,
there is no guarantee the order in which the elements are stored in it:
`<a>` can appear before or after `<p>`.

[source,go]
----
// Unordered output:
// <a>: 3
// <p>: 1
----
