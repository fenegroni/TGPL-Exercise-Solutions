{badge-exercise}

The instructor of the _linear algebra_ course decides that
_calculus_ is now a prerequisite.
Extend the `topoSort` function to report cycles.

== Test

In validating the list produced by `topoSort`
in _Exercise 5.10_, we accidentally figured out
how to detect a cycle in a graph.

We add a new test `TestTopoSortCyclicGraph`
which errors if `topoSort` fails to detect a cyclic graph,
on top of all the checks we already performed
in _Exercise 5.10_.

The new `topoSort` implements
uses an additional map `dependents`
to detect cyclic dependencies and
returns an error if the graph has a cycle.
