Write a program `wordfreq`
to report the frequency of each word in an input text file.
Call `input.Split(bufio.ScanWords)` before the first call to `Scan`
to break the input into words instead of lines.

== Test

We test a function called `WordFreq` that receives the input as an `os.Reader`.

In `main` we can pass os.Stdin as the input file to `WordFreq`.

In `TestWordFreq` we can use string literals or
we can build large inputs using `strings.Builder`.

TODO: decide which approach to take

== Example

Given this string literal as input:

[literal]
The red fox jumped over the box.
The red box didn't move over.

the Example function's `Unordered output` is:

[source]
----
// Unordered output:
// 3 the
// 2 red
// 2 over
// 2 box
// 1 jumped
// 1 fox
// 1 didn't
// 1 move
----
